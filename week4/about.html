 <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Thank you for taking the time to read over my remedeation process, I hope I was able transfer my academic writing skills over into website form as smoothly as possible. I am entering my final year as a Graduate Student at Texas Christian University. When I leave TCU, I will graduate with my Masters in Liberal Arts after serving two years for the football team as a graduate assistant equipment manager. Before my time at TCU, I attended Oklahoma State University from the fall of 2020 until the spring of 2024 in which I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Sports Management and Marketing. After college, I plan to pursue a full-time roll in Sports equipment whether that be in professional sports or collegiate sports. </p>
  <p>Ever since I was a little boy, I have been a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and superheroes as a whole. When I had the opportunity to write a 15 page paper on a superhero of choice, my immediate choice was Ant-Man. His story has always been compelling to me. Quite frankly, I really enjoy how human he is and how much being a dad plays into his overall story as well as his character arc. He might be small, but he sure is mighty, which also played a key role in why I chose Ant-Man. It was a no brainer type of decision for me, and if I had the chance to do it again, I most definitely would.  </p>
