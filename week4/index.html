  <h3>Graduate Assistant for Football Equipment Operations at TCU</h3>
  <p>Hi, my name is Jake Pendleton. I’m currently a Graduate Student at Texas Christian University, and I am excited to share my portfolio style, fully functional website with you all. I am your sterotypical college male, I love sports and video games. I am a very determined, motivated, and committed individual; therefore, I have committed to this course and this assignment as a sign of my committment to a higher education and more diversified knowledge pool. I’m excited to continue growing as a student in my final year of college, and as a new coder and/or "website builder".</p>

 <h2>Featured Project: Antman- The Power of Fatherhood, Redemption, and Legacy</h2>
 <p>My research on Ant-Man consists of common themes like fatherhood, redemption, and even second chances in what all three ultimately tie together and form a klegacy unlike any other eithin the superhero realm. Ant-Man might be physically small, but he is big at heart and thats all that matters when it comes to his legacy. His charcter goes through many physical and emotional battles, but still somehow proceeds to put his life as a human ahead of his life as a hero day in and day out. </p>

 <h2>My Research</h2>
 <p>I want to encourage you to click on the "RESEARCH" tab at the top of this page to view my Content Remediation assignment. My scholarly work is centered around the ver-lasting legacy cemented into time by the MCU character Ant-Man. My Capstone assessment in the spring of 2025 was to conduct research and write a 15-page paper on Ant-Man's (the comic versions) character. In this assignment I was told to both dig deep and dive deep into the background of the charcter to truly undertand his "why". I spent alomst an entire semester devoting time and resources to this conducted research, ultimately i published my findings and recieved excellent feedback from both my professors and my peers. I firmly believe this is a piece of work you should see if you are a fan of superheroes, Marvel, or even just Ant-Man in general. Either way, thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you have some time to spend scrolling through my hard work and research. </p>
