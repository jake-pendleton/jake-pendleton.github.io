  <h3>Graduate Assistant for Football Equipment Operations at TCU</h3>
  <p>Hi, my name is Jake Pendleton. I’m currently a Graduate Student at Texas Christian University, and I am excited to share my portfolio style, fully functional website with you all. I am your sterotypical college male, I love sports ad video games. I am a very determined, motivated, and committed individual; therefore, I have committed to this course and this assignment as a sign of my committment to a higher education and more diversified knowledge pool. I’m excited to continue growing as a student in my final year of college, and as a new coder and/or "website builder". </p>
