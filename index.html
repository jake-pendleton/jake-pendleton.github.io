  <h1>HTML Activity: CRAP Principles Website Analysis</h1>
  <h2>By: Jake Pendleton</h2>
  <p>Excuse my mess, but this is my first ever attempt at creating an HTML webpage.</p>
  <p>For this assignment I am choosing to analyze my alma mater's <a href= "https://go.okstate.edu/">(Oklahoma State University)</a> homepage. After spending four years as an undergraduate student at this university, I can say very confidently that I was a frequent visitor to this site and am quite familiar with it.</p>
