  <h1>Ant-Man</h1>
  <h3>The Power of Fatherhood, Redemption, and Legacy</h3>
 
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Ant-Man's character has ultimately redefined what it truly means to be a superhero. Ant-Man's character reinforces the common superhero myth that is redemption, while also reminding us that redemption is a continuous path that can be achieved through many everyday activities such as fatherhood, second-chances, and many different personal growth opportunities. Overall, the character of Scott Lang, interestingly enough leaves behind a larger than life legacy for such a wee-little man.

  <h2>Process/Methods</h2>
  <p>For this research, I utilized many different adaptations of Marvel Comic Books covering Ant-Man across a very vast set of years. This research was put together by myself as a collective reminder that Ant-Man is one of the more beloved chararcaters in the MCU, although he is almost always forgotten. This work also heavily emphasizes these traits as it pertains to Comic Book versions of Scott Lang.</p>
  <p>From a non-scholarly stand point, Ant-Man has been one of my favorite MCU superheroes for a long time, falling just behind Super-Man as my favorite. He seems so small, yet he is still so mighty in many different ways. I feel as if he is often over-looked which peaked my interest into this topic when I was tasked with discussing a super-hero of my choice and my most recent graduate studies course. </p>
