  <h1>Ant-Man</h1>
  <h3>The Power of Fatherhood, Redemption, and Legacy</h3>
 
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Ant-Man's character has ultimately redefined what it truly means to be a superhero. Ant-Man's character reinforces the common superhero myth that is redemption, while also reminding us that redemption is a continuous path that can be achieved through many everyday activities such as fatherhood, second-chances, and many different personal growth opportunities. Overall, the character of Scott Lang, interestingly enough leaves behind a larger than life legacy for such a wee-little man.
    
  <h2>Key-Points</h2>

     <li>Sacrifice
     Second Chances
     Personal Growth</li>
   </ul>
  
  <h2>Process/Methods</h2>
  <p>For this research, I utilized many different adaptations of Marvel Comic Books covering Ant-Man across a very vast set of years. This research was put together by myself as a collective reminder that Ant-Man is one of the more beloved chararcaters in the MCU, although he is almost always forgotten. This work also heavily emphasizes these traits as it pertains to Comic Book versions of Scott Lang.</p>
  <p>From a non-scholarly stand point, Ant-Man has been one of my favorite MCU superheroes for a long time, falling just behind Super-Man as my favorite. He seems so small, yet he is still so mighty in many different ways. I feel as if he is often over-looked which peaked my interest into this topic when I was tasked with discussing a super-hero of my choice and my most recent graduate studies course. </p>
  
  <h2>Significance</h2>
  <p>Ant-Man is just as important and arguably even more important than some of the other more beloved MCU charcters in my mind as well as many others minds. He is crucial to Superhero development as a whole. His charcter does not shy away from the fact that he is just as much, if not more, human than he is hero. Not every hero has to have super strength, or the ability to fly, or even slay a villain to serve their purpose. Some of these heroes purposes can be served off of the "battlefield" which is exactly where the majority of Scott Lang's legacy forms. Overall, it is important to show love to the smaller characters as well; better yet, it is important to tell their stories just as the Marvel writers intended for it to be told. </p>
