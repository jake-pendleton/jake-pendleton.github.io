<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Jacob Pendleton, but I go by Jake, and I am from Denison, TX. Denison is about an hour and half North of Fort Worth, and only has a city population of about 30,000 people. We are slowly growing in size as people continue to pour into this great state; however, the small town atmosphere is still alive... at least for now. I was fortunate to move back to texas for Grad School after I decided to move into Oklahoma for my Undergraduate studies. You can find more about my education experiences and past in the "About" section of my website. </p>
