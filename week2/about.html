  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h3>Academic Background:</h3>
  <p>I was a "COVID" highschool graduate in 2020, fortunately, I was able to have an in person graduation. I then moved off to college in Oklahoma, where I graduated from Oklahoma State University in May of 2024 with a Bachelor's Degree, in which I declared a Major in Sports Management and a Minor in Marketing.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am heading into my second, and hopefully, final year as a graduate student here at TCU. I am on pace to graduate in May of 2026 with my Master's Degree in Liberal Arts. I do unfortunately believe that this will be the end of my academic career.</p>
