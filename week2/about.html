  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h3>Academic Background:</h3>
  <p>I was a "COVID" highschool graduate in 2020, fortunately, I was able to have an in person graduation. I then moved off to college in Oklahoma, where I graduated from Oklahoma State University in May of 2024 with a Bachelor's Degree, in which I declared a Major in Sports Management and a Minor in Marketing. I was a consistent member of the Dean's Honor Roll and was an active fraternity member while continuously involving myself in various other clubs and activities. </p>
  <p>Currently, I am heading into my second, and hopefully, final year as a graduate student here at TCU. I am on pace to graduate in May of 2026 with my Master's Degree in Liberal Arts. I do unfortunately believe that this will be the end of my academic career. There are always chances to learn and grow in life, but as for "true" classroom learning, I am on my ride off into the sunset. </p>

  <h3>Interest In Web Development:</h3>

  <h3>Professional Goals:</h3>
  <p>As mentioned in my intoduction video last week, I am currently a Graduate Assistant Equipment Manager with the TCU Football program. My end-game goal with this profession is to be a Director of Football Equipment Operations for a "Power 4" program. I am currently heading into my sith year/season as an equipment manager. I spent four years at Oklahoma State, one NFL training camp with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2023, and I am heading into year two with TCU. As a twenty-three year old young man, the free travel, free clothes, and free tickets to football games are way too enticing to pass up. Obviously, while I am in this kind of roll, the end-goal would be to work for an NFL team full-time. The only issue with that is that each team has at most five full-time equipment managers and those guys do not leave unless they get fired or retire. Selfishly, I want to either win a national championship or a Super Bowl, and oly then do I think I would call it quits almost immediately. </p>
  <p>Eventually, there will become a time where I will want to settle down, get married, have kids, and just enjoy a normal 9-5 family lifestyle. However, I will continue to pursue this passion while I'm young and continue traveling the country and watching football games for free while getting paid to do so. Eventually I would like to use my Sports Management and/or Marketing degree to further advance my opportunities in the sports world. There are a few roles that interest me such as as being a Director of Football Operations, Director of Player Personnel, or even a General manager for a collegiate sports team. I always wanted to be a professional sports agent; however, as life advances and moves on, I believe I am on the right track to achieve these personal goals and aspirations through the connections and relationships I build daily. </p>

  <h3>Skills I'm Developing:</h3>
