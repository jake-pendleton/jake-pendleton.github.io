  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Academic Background:</h2>
  <p>I was a "COVID" highschool graduate in 2020, fortunately, I was able to have an in person graduation. I then moved off to college in Oklahoma, where I graduated from Oklahoma State University in May of 2024 with a Bachelor's Degree, in which I declared a Major in Sports Management and a Minor in Marketing. I was a consistent member of the Dean's Honor Roll and was an active fraternity member while continuously involving myself in various other clubs and activities. </p>
  <p>Currently, I am heading into my second, and hopefully, final year as a graduate student here at TCU. I am on pace to graduate in May of 2026 with my Master's Degree in Liberal Arts. I do unfortunately believe that this will be the end of my academic career. There are always chances to learn and grow in life, but as for "true" classroom learning, I am on my ride off into the sunset. </p>

  <h2>Interest In Web Development:</h2>
  <p>As mentioned before, I am not necessarily super intigued with the whole process of web-development. Even though we are only two weeks into this course, I seem to be having a hard time following along and comprehending a lot of steps. Which is odd, because i'm supposed to be a tech-savvy young adult right? I always accidentaly press buttons on my keyboard that open up some form of coding for whatever web-page I am on, so I will admit this did peek my curiosity into the topic. I also hae enjoyed learning how to build a website from scratch; I have a new found appreciation for website builders and designers. </p>
  <p>I will say, my roommate and fellow classmate John is very passionate about this kind of stuff. He is always talking about coding and building websites, so I was intrigued at the idea of learning a little bit about the concept he cares so much about. I now have a better sense of understanding as to why he is so passionate about this type of work.  </p>

  
  <h2>Professional Goals:</h2>
  <p>As mentioned in my intoduction video last week, I am currently a Graduate Assistant Equipment Manager with the TCU Football program. My end-game goal with this profession is to be a Director of Football Equipment Operations for a "Power 4" program. I am currently heading into my sith year/season as an equipment manager. I spent four years at Oklahoma State, one NFL training camp with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2023, and I am heading into year two with TCU. As a twenty-three year old young man, the free travel, free clothes, and free tickets to football games are way too enticing to pass up. Obviously, while I am in this kind of roll, the end-goal would be to work for an NFL team full-time. The only issue with that is that each team has at most five full-time equipment managers and those guys do not leave unless they get fired or retire. Selfishly, I want to either win a National Championship or a Super Bowl, and only then do I think I would call it quits almost immediately. </p>
  <p>Eventually, there will become a time where I will want to settle down, get married, have kids, and just enjoy a normal 9-5 family lifestyle. However, I will continue to pursue this passion while I'm young and continue traveling the country and watching football games for free while getting paid to do so. Eventually I would like to use my Sports Management and/or Marketing degree to further advance my opportunities in the sports world. There are a few roles that interest me such as as being a Director of Football Operations, Director of Player Personnel, or even a General manager for a collegiate sports team. I always wanted to be a professional sports agent; however, as life advances and moves on, I believe I am on the right track to achieve these personal goals and aspirations through the connections and relationships I build daily. </p>

  <h2>Skills I'm Developing:</h2>
  <p>So far in this course, I am learning fundamental HTML coding and CSS principles. I am also developing essential skills in building and styling basic web pages and learning how to structure content using HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and links. </p>
  <p> Additionally, I am gaining experience in using CSS to control the visual presentation of web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. These skills are helping me understand how websites are designed and how HTML and CSS work together to create user-friendly and visually appealing web experiences.</p>
