  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <h2>Academic Background:</h2>
  <p>I was a "COVID" high school graduate in 2020. Fortunately, I was able to have an in-person graduation. I then moved off to college in Oklahoma, where I graduated from Oklahoma State University in May of 2024 with a Bachelor's Degree, majoring in Sports Management and minoring in Marketing. I was a consistent member of the Dean's Honor Roll, an active fraternity member, and involved in various other clubs and activities.</p>
  
  <p>Currently, I am heading into my second—and hopefully final—year as a graduate student at TCU. I’m on pace to graduate in May 2026 with my Master's Degree in Liberal Arts. I do believe this will be the end of my formal academic career. There are always opportunities to learn in life, but as for “true” classroom learning, I’m on my ride off into the sunset.</p>

  <h2>Interest In Web Development:</h2>
  <p>As mentioned before, I’m not necessarily super intrigued with the whole process of web development. Even though we’re only two weeks into this course, I’m having a hard time following along and comprehending a lot of the steps—which is odd, because I’m supposed to be a tech-savvy young adult, right? I always accidentally press buttons on my keyboard that open up some kind of code editor on whatever page I’m visiting, so I’ll admit that did pique my curiosity.</p>
  
  <p>My roommate and fellow classmate John is very passionate about coding. He’s always talking about building websites, so I was intrigued by the idea of learning more about the subject he cares so much about. I now have a better understanding of why this type of work can be so rewarding.</p>

  <h2>Professional Goals:</h2>
  <p>As mentioned in my introduction video, I am currently a Graduate Assistant Equipment Manager with the TCU Football program. My end goal in this profession is to become a Director of Football Equipment Operations for a "Power 4" program. I’m heading into my sixth year/season as an equipment manager. I spent four years at Oklahoma State, one NFL training camp with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2023, and I’m starting my second year at TCU.</p>
  
  <p>As a 23-year-old, the free travel, gear, and tickets are hard to pass up. The ultimate goal would be to work for an NFL team full-time. The challenge is that each NFL team only employs about five full-time equipment managers—and they
